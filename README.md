To become a GitHub pro and enhance your skills on the platform, it's important to understand and utilize basics and advanced concepts and features. Here are some concepts that can help you become proficient in GitHub:

1). Learn and undertsand the basics/fundamentals, note that the basics/fundamentals never change, regardless of the platform that you are using. 

2). Branching and Merging: Branching allows you to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel without interfering with the main codebase. Understanding how to create, switch between, and delete branches, as well as merging changes back into the main branch (usually master or main), is crucial for effective collaboration.

3). Pull Requests: Pull Requests (PRs) are a fundamental aspect of collaboration on GitHub. Knowing how to create a PR, review code changes, provide feedback, and merge PRs is essential. You should also understand how to resolve conflicts that may arise during the merging process.

4). Git Workflow: Familiarize yourself with popular Git workflows such as Git Flow or GitHub Flow. These workflows provide guidelines on branching strategies, release management, and collaboration patterns. Understanding the workflow your team or project follows will help you navigate the development process more efficiently.

5). Git Submodules and Git Subtrees: These advanced Git features allow you to include external repositories within your own repository. They are particularly useful for managing dependencies or including shared code across projects.

6). Git Hooks: Git hooks enable you to trigger custom scripts at specific points in the Git workflow. You can automate tasks like code formatting, running tests, or triggering deployment scripts. Learning how to set up and use Git hooks can significantly improve your development workflow.

7). GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions is a powerful workflow automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub. You can create custom workflows to automate tasks, run tests, build and deploy applications, and more. Understanding how to configure and use GitHub Actions can save you time and enhance your project's development lifecycle.

8). Issue and Project Management: GitHub offers built-in issue tracking and project management features. Explore how to create and manage issues, assign tasks to collaborators, use labels and milestones effectively, and set up project boards to visualize and track the progress of your work.

9). GitHub API: GitHub provides a comprehensive API that allows you to interact with repositories, issues, pull requests, and other resources programmatically. Understanding the GitHub API can empower you to build custom integrations, automate workflows, or create tools that enhance your GitHub experience.

10). Markdown: GitHub supports Markdown for documentation, README files, and issue/PR descriptions. Familiarize yourself with Markdown syntax to create well-formatted and visually appealing content.

11). Code Review: Developing good code review skills is essential for effective collaboration. Learn how to provide constructive feedback, address code quality issues, and communicate your thoughts effectively in code reviews. Use features like line comments, suggestions, and reviewing changes within PRs.

**Remember, continuous learning and practice are key to becoming proficient on GitHub. Experiment with these concepts, explore the GitHub documentation, and actively participate in open-source projects or collaborative development to refine your skills.**
